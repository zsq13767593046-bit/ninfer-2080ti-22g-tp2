// Head-local half of Gqa27Geometry for two-way tensor parallelism. Device r owns
// Q heads [r*12,(r+1)*12) and KV heads [r*2,(r+1)*2); its KV pool stores ONLY those two head
// pairs, so every KV head index the kernels compute is LOCAL (0 or 1) and every Q head index is
// local (0..11). GroupSize stays 6, so the Q-head -> KV-head grouping `qh / GroupSize` is the
// same arithmetic the tp1 geometry runs -- this is a geometry instantiation, not a new algorithm.
//
// DecodeSplitScale compensates the halved KV-head count in the split-KV decode grid, whose x
// extent is exactly KVHeads: 24|4 runs 4 x 85 = 340 CTAs, 16|2 runs 2 x 170 = 340, and 12|2 with
// scale 2 also runs 2 x 170 = 340. Each device drives its own GPU, so the per-device occupancy
// target is the whole 170-SM board, not half of one. This is the same inherited-tuning rule every
// split form here follows: the split reuses its family's measured policy rather than re-deriving
// one.

// The cache-append kernels (A2) read Geometry::KVHeads and nothing else -- no Q-head count, no
// group size, no split policy -- so any two geometries with the same KV-head count produce the
// same append kernel. Gqa27Tp2Geometry and Gqa35Geometry both carry 2, which makes selection by
// KV-head count over the full registry ambiguous: two entries would match. This sub-list resolves
// that by naming one representative per distinct KV-head count, and it is what the standalone
// `gqa_kv_append` entry point (which has no Q heads to select on) dispatches over, so that
// selection is a function and reordering either list cannot change which kernel runs.
//
// It is NOT a code-size mechanism: `gqa_attention_prompt_launch` reaches
// `gqa_kv_append_launch_for<Geometry>` through the full `dispatch_gqa_geometry`, so the append
// kernels are instantiated for every registered geometry regardless of what appears here.
// gqa_geometry_dispatch.cuh static_asserts that every entry of NINFER_GQA_GEOMETRIES has a
// representative here, so registering a geometry with a NEW KV-head count is a compile error until
// it is added.
