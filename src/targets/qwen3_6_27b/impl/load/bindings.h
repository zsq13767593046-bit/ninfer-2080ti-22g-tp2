// --- TP2 host-side sharding map ---
//
// A `Shard` names one contiguous row range of an object's *logical* 2D matrix that lives on
// one device. `row_begin`/`row_count` always index the same axis the object is bound with in
// `bind_weight`/`bind_device_tensor` above (the artifact's stored [rows, columns] shape), with
// one exception documented per family below:
//
//   - column-parallel objects (the output/row dimension is split, e.g. fused QKV-gate
//     projections, GDN input_projection, MLP gate_up, gdn_gating a/b, a_log/dt_bias, vocab
//     row-splits): `row_begin`/`row_count` slice the object's real stored rows directly. The
//     `row-split-k128-v1` storage layout (src/artifact/storage_layouts.cpp) encodes each row
//     independently, so any row boundary is a valid split point there -- the only requirement is
//     *head alignment* (never cut a projection head/group in half). Formats that can be bound in
//     the NVFP4 profile use `blockscale-k16-m128x4-v1` instead, which is NOT row-independent (see
//     `is_column_parallel_boundary_valid` below).
//   - row-parallel objects (the input/column dimension is split, e.g. o_proj, GDN out_proj, MLP
//     down): the object is stored as [out_rows, in_columns], but a Shard's `row_begin`/
//     `row_count` here index the INPUT dimension -- i.e. rows of the object's *transposed* view.
//     `row-split-k128-v1` groups each row's columns into 64- or
//     32-wide quantization groups, so a column split of a `row-split-k128-v1` object must land on
//     a group boundary (see `is_row_parallel_boundary_valid` below for what this does and does
//     not cover).
//   - channel-split objects (`gdn/convolution`, the only member): a depthwise conv1d weight whose
//     ONE meaningful axis is the channel, and whose storage orientation puts that axis in the
//     artifact's COLUMNS -- stored [4 taps, 10240 channels], while the runtime Tensor is the
//     transpose {10240, 4} and the kernels index it `weight[tap * C + c]`. So this family shares
//     the row-parallel families' axis (`ShardAxis::Columns`, `row_begin`/`row_count` index the
//     stored column dimension) but not their meaning: nothing is reduced across devices, and the
//     boundary requirement is head alignment, exactly as for the column-parallel families. It is
//     also the ONLY family whose per-device shard is MORE THAN ONE range on the column axis: the
//     10240 channels are the GDN input projection's Q(2048) | K(2048) | V(6144) block, each
//     section split by its own head count, so device r owns three disjoint channel blocks
//     concatenated in Q|K|V order (see `plan_for`'s `gdn/convolution` branch). `artifact::
//     tensor_column_slice` admits multiple ranges for `contiguous-le-v1` only -- which this object
//     always is (BF16) -- and rejects them for every grouped/tiled/swizzled layout, so no
//     row-parallel GEMM family can accidentally acquire a multi-range shard.
//   - replicated objects (norms, token_embedding, gdn/norm, draft_head_token_ids): `shards` is
//     empty, meaning a full copy lives on every device (see `WeightPlan::shards` below).
//     `gdn/norm` belongs here on its merits, not by default: its bound shape is {128}, the
//     per-head-DIMENSION `gated_rmsnorm` gain applied as `weight[d]` while normalizing over
//     ne[0]=128, so it carries no head axis to split and every device needs all of it.
//     `draft_head_token_ids` (I32 [131072]) is here for a different reason: it maps a draft-head
//     ROW INDEX to a tokenizer id and is consumed AFTER a GLOBAL argmax over the allgathered
//     131072-wide proposal logits, so the winning index can name a row in either device's half
//     and the sampling device needs the whole map. Its companion weight `draft_head` is still
//     vocab-row-split. Note that neither `gdn/convolution` (channel-split, above) nor
//     `draft_head_token_ids` belongs to the vocab row-split family, however plausible that
//     placement looks from the object names alone.
//
// `tp == 1` always degenerates to an empty ShardPlan for every object (full copy on device 0),
// matching `WeightPlan::shards`'s "empty => replicated/full on device 0" convention; this is the
// same convention used for genuinely-replicated objects, so tp1 callers cannot tell sharded and
// replicated objects apart, by design (there is only one device).

//   - `row-split-k128-v1`: columns are packed into quantization groups (64 for Q4/Q5/Q6G64, 32

//     K-alignment unit and a multiple of both group sizes; requiring it additionally makes each
//     shard's own K_pad equal to its K, so no shard inherits the parent's trailing padding
//     groups. This is the binding (strictest) constraint of the three.
//   - `blockscale-k16-m128x4-v1`: the scale plane's second axis is the 64-column scale tile, so
//     columns must be a multiple of 64. 128 satisfies it.
//   - `row-scale-v1`: the code plane is row-major bytes and the BF16 multiplier is per row, so

// defensive: the swizzled scale plane stores word (n, g) at
// `(floor(n/128) * K_tiles + floor(g/4)) * 512 + (n%32) * 16 + floor((n%128)/32) * 4 + g%4`

// as `reshape(N/128, 4, 32, K_tiles, 4).permute(0, 3, 2, 1, 4)`). Rows are therefore interleaved

//   - the split-storage twins `attention/query_key`, `attention/gate_value`, `gdn/query_key`,
//     `gdn/value_z`. These exist only in `bind_groupwise_text_layers`, always Q4G64/Q5G64, hence

//   - `gdn_gating` (`gdn/a_projection`, `gdn/b_projection`, `gdn/a_log`, `gdn/dt_bias`,

//     24-row halves that are not 128-aligned by construction.
//   - the vocab row-splits (`output_head`, `draft_head`): always `row-split-k128-v1` or
//     `row-scale-v1`, both row-independent.
// If any of those families ever gains an NVFP4 binding, `tensor_row_slice` rejects a misaligned
