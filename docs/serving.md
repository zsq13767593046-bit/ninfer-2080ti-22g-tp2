# HTTP serving

`build/apps/ninfer-serve` loads one registered artifact and exposes OpenAI- and
Anthropic-compatible HTTP endpoints over one resident NInfer Engine.

## Start the server

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080 \
  --max-context 16384 \
  --kv-capacity 32768 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

For the 35B-A3B artifact, select its artifact path; the public model ID follows the container
identity automatically:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer \
  --max-context 16384 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

When `--model-id` is omitted, the server advertises and accepts the loaded container's exact
`identity.model_id`. An explicit `--model-id` remains a public HTTP alias override and does not
select or alter the artifact.

Vision is disabled by default: its weights, Vision scratch phase, and frozen request-transient
buffer are not allocated, and media
requests and token-count requests fail with HTTP 400 `vision_disabled`. Add `--vision` when the
server must accept image or video input. Speculative residency is likewise frozen by
`--spec mtp|dflash` and `--draft-tokens`; omitting `--spec` loads neither backend.
`--lm-head-draft` additionally loads the optimized proposal head. DFlash is 35B-A3B text-only and
cannot be combined with `--vision`. A later request cannot enable a capability omitted at startup.

`--tp 2` splits one model across two GPUs and requires an explicit `--devices A,B` naming one
distinct device per rank. It supports `--spec mtp` (with `--draft-tokens` and `--lm-head-draft`);
it does not support `--spec dflash` or `--vision`, and both are rejected at startup with a message
naming the unsupported feature.

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --tp 2 --devices 0,1 \
  --max-context 262144 --kv-capacity auto --kv-dtype int8 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft
```

### Extended context: `--rope yarn`

`--rope native` (the default) runs the checkpoint's own rotary embedding and caps `--max-context`
at the artifact's registered native position capacity, `262144`. `--rope yarn` applies YaRN
frequency correction to the text rotary subspace and raises that ceiling to
`--yarn-origin` x `--yarn-factor`, up to a product maximum of `1048576` tokens:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --tp 2 --devices 0,1 \
  --rope yarn --yarn-factor 4.0 --yarn-origin 262144 \
  --max-context 1048576 --kv-capacity auto --kv-dtype int8
```

`--yarn-origin` must equal the artifact's registered native capacity (`262144`); a different origin
is rejected at startup rather than silently reinterpreted, because the correction table is derived
from that exact window. `--yarn-factor` accepts a finite value in `[1.0, 64.0]` and defaults to `4.0`;
`origin x factor` must land on a whole number of tokens at or below `1048576`.

YaRN is available at `--tp 1` as well as `--tp 2` -- the flag is independent of tensor parallelism,
though the KV pool for a very long context is what usually decides which width fits. It is rejected
together with `--vision` (the vision encoder ropes 2-D image-grid positions through its own table)
and with `--spec dflash` (a different rotary geometry), and it is only offered by targets whose
text attention carries a YaRN rope domain -- `qwen3.6-27b`/`qwen3.8-27b`; `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` rejects
it at startup. Under `--rope native` nothing about the rope path changes, at either `--tp` width.

The server's startup record and the CLI load summary both report the resolved regime: mode, factor,
origin, the effective max-context ceiling, and the YaRN `mscale` multiplier.

At the full `1048576` ceiling the configuration is single-slot: one sequence costs 16.66 GiB per
device without a speculative backend and 17.69 GiB with `--spec mtp --draft-tokens 3`, so
`--max-concurrency` must be `1` and a second slot cannot be allocated on a 32 GiB card. Concurrency
at extended context requires a smaller `--max-context` (roughly 500,000 tokens for two slots at
INT8 KV). `--kv-dtype int8` is mandatory at that window.

One caveat applies to that combination: **prefix reuse is unavailable at `--tp 2` with
`--spec mtp`**. Resuming a prefix drives the MTP head from a retained target hidden state that
only the primary device holds, so such a request is prefilled again from the start instead of
resumed. The answer is unchanged and no request fails -- only the reuse saving is lost, which
matters for multi-turn conversations at long context. `--tp 2` without `--spec mtp` reuses
prefixes normally except for a submission whose reusable prefix already covers the whole prompt,
which is likewise downgraded to a full prefill.

## OpenAI Chat Completions

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.6-27b",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "Answer concisely."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is speculative decoding?"}
    ],
    "max_tokens": 128
  }'
```

The endpoint supports:

- `system`, `developer`, `user`, `assistant`, and `tool` history;
- string content and ordered text, `image_url`, and `video_url` parts;
- `max_completion_tokens` and the legacy `max_tokens` spelling;
- `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, presence/frequency penalties, and a nonnegative `seed`;
- one stop string or an array of stop strings;
- non-streaming responses and server-sent event streams;
- `stream_options.include_usage`;
- function tools, tool choices, assistant tool-call history, and tool-result messages;
- the top-level `reasoning_effort` field;
- the `enable_thinking` extension;
- `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking` and the top-level `preserve_thinking` alias.

The request `model` must equal the public model ID: the artifact `identity.model_id` by default, or
the explicit `--model-id` override. Reasoning is returned separately as `reasoning_content`; answer
text remains in `content`.

Message roles retain their input order through schema translation. The Qwen family frontend maps
both `system` and `developer` to system-class ChatML blocks at their original positions; it does not
move later instructions to the beginning of the conversation. A leading instruction keeps the
artifact template's existing tool/reasoning-instruction composition.

At startup, NInfer resolves prompt capabilities from the exact `frontend/chat_template.jinja`
resource embedded in the loaded artifact. It does not infer them from the request's `model` field,
the artifact identity, or a target profile. A recognized effort-capable template exposes `low`,
`medium`, and `xhigh`; omitting effort uses that template's declared default. An explicit effort
not exposed by the loaded template returns HTTP 400 with code
`reasoning_effort_not_supported` before prompt preparation.

For Chat Completions, `reasoning_effort: "none"` disables thinking. `low`, `medium`, and `xhigh`
select the corresponding template effort when available. The other OpenAI protocol values
`minimal`, `high`, and `max` are parsed but rejected when the loaded template does not expose them.
`enable_thinking` controls the same new-turn thinking switch; a contradictory combination with
`reasoning_effort` returns `conflicting_template_option`.

`preserve_thinking` controls whether reasoning from closed assistant turns remains in later
prompts. It defaults to the server setting, which is off unless `--preserve-thinking` is used. If
both OpenAI spellings are present they must carry the same boolean value. Unknown non-null
`chat_template_kwargs` are rejected.

Streaming begins with an assistant-role chunk, sends separate reasoning and content deltas, then a
finish-reason chunk and `[DONE]`. When `stream_options.include_usage` is true, a final empty
`choices` chunk contains completed usage.

### Multimodal request

Start the server with `--vision` before sending media:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.6-27b",
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/image.png"}},
        {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."}
      ]
    }],
    "max_tokens": 128
  }'
```

OpenAI image and video sources may be HTTP(S) URLs or base64 data URLs.

Text and media requests use one complete-prompt context contract. After chat-template rendering and
media-token expansion, the result must fit Engine `--max-context`. The current Vision runtime also
has a 32,768 merged-token envelope (131,072 raw patches); the effective Vision limit is therefore
`min(--max-context, 32768)`. There is no fixed image/video item-count limit: item count is admitted
through aggregate source-byte, decoded-pixel, raw-patch, Vision-token, and live-memory budgets.

Media cache misses run as independent decode → resize → BF16-pack tasks on a bounded host worker
pool. Prepared payloads are keyed by SHA-256 of the acquired bytes plus modality, so repeated media
in later requests reuses the exact immutable BF16 patch input; concurrent identical misses use one
single-flight build. `--media-cache-mib` bounds LRU-retained payloads, while
`--media-live-mib` bounds every cache-, request-, or runtime-referenced payload. Cache eviction does
not invalidate a request reference, and live bytes are returned only when the final reference is
released. A request-level preparation gate derived from the live limit prevents concurrent partial
builds from deadlocking the memory account.

An expanded prompt beyond `--max-context` returns HTTP 400 `context_length_exceeded`, including
the prepared token count and configured context ceiling. A media preprocessing resource rejection
returns HTTP 400 `media_budget_exceeded`. HTTP 413 `request_too_large` is reserved for a raw request
body that exceeds `--max-request-mib` before JSON parsing; it is not used for model-context or media
resource errors.

## OpenAI Responses Core

NInfer implements the typed-Item and semantic-event core of the OpenAI
[Responses API](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/responses/overview). All
registered artifact identities use this same adapter and Engine route. It is intentionally not
advertised as full parity with OpenAI-hosted tools, durable cloud storage, background jobs,
Conversations, or compaction.

### Create a Response

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/responses \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.6-27b",
    "instructions": "Answer concisely.",
    "input": "What is speculative decoding?",
    "max_output_tokens": 128,
    "store": true
  }'
```

The same endpoint works with OpenAI SDKs by replacing their base URL:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="local-secret")
response = client.responses.create(
    model="qwen3.6-27b",
    instructions="Answer concisely.",
    input="What is speculative decoding?",
    max_output_tokens=128,
)
print(response.output_text)  # SDK helper derived from response.output
```

`output_text` is an SDK convenience property. It is not emitted as a top-level wire field; the
wire response contains typed `output` Items.

### Create request fields

| Field | NInfer Responses Core contract |
|---|---|
| `model` | required non-empty string; must equal the artifact-derived public model ID or explicit `--model-id` override |
| `input` | required string or non-empty typed Item array |
| `instructions` | optional string, inserted before the reconstructed conversation for this request only |
| `previous_response_id` | optional ID of a retained local Response |
| `max_output_tokens` | integer at least `16`; default is `--default-max-tokens` |
| `stream` | boolean; `true` selects Responses SSE rather than a JSON body |
| `store` | boolean, default `true`; controls local retrieval and continuation state |
| `temperature` | finite number in `[0,2]` |
| `top_p` | finite number in `[0,1]` |
| `metadata` | at most 16 string pairs; keys at most 64 characters and values at most 512 |
| `reasoning.effort` | `none` disables thinking; `low`, `medium`, or `xhigh` selects an effort exposed by the loaded chat template; `minimal`, `high`, and `max` return `reasoning_effort_not_supported` for the registered templates |
| `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking` | optional boolean controlling whether closed-turn reasoning remains in reconstructed prompts |
| `preserve_thinking` | top-level alias for the same option; conflicting values are rejected |
| `text.format` | omitted or `{"type":"text"}` only |
| `tools` | flat Responses function definitions; see below |
| `tool_choice` | `auto` or `none` |
| `parallel_tool_calls` | omitted or `true` |
| `truncation` | omitted or `disabled`; overlong input fails instead of silently dropping Items |
| `top_logprobs` | omitted or `0` |
| `service_tier` | omitted, `auto`, or `default`; the response reports `default` |
| `background` | omitted or `false` |
| `include` | omitted or an empty array |
| `stream_options` | omitted or `{"include_obfuscation":false}` |

Unknown top-level fields fail with `unknown_parameter`. Recognized but unsupported features fail
with a field-specific 400 error instead of being silently ignored.

### Input Item contract

String `input` is normalized to one user `message` with an `input_text` part. Array input accepts:

| Item | Supported form |
|---|---|
| `message` | roles `user`, `assistant`, `system`, and `developer`; string content or typed content array |
| `input_text` | message content part containing string `text` |
| `output_text` | assistant-message replay part containing string `text` |
| `input_image` | user-message part with HTTP(S) or data-URI `image_url`; detail omitted or `auto`; requires server `--vision` |
| `input_video` | NInfer extension with HTTP(S) or data-URI `video_url`; requires server `--vision` |
| `reasoning` | raw replay Item with an empty `summary` and `reasoning_text` content parts |
| `function_call` | completed assistant call with optional `id`, and required `call_id`, `name`, and JSON-object string `arguments` |
| `function_call_output` | completed tool result with required `call_id` and string `output` |

Adjacent function-call Items are grouped into one assistant history turn. A reasoning Item attaches
to the following assistant message or function call. Input Item IDs are preserved when supplied and
generated otherwise; duplicate IDs fail.

System and developer message Items retain their positions in the input array. Top-level
`instructions` is represented as a leading developer turn for the current request; target-specific
role lowering occurs only in the Qwen family frontend.

`input_file`, `input_audio`, image `file_id`, non-`auto` image detail, reasoning summaries or
encrypted reasoning, message `phase`, and other Item/content types are not supported. HTTP media
URLs stored in a response chain are fetched again when that chain is continued; use data URIs when
the historical media bytes must be immutable.

### Function tools

Responses function definitions are flat rather than Chat Completions' nested `function` object:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Get current weather",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
    "required": ["city"]
  },
  "strict": false
}
```

NInfer renders these definitions in the Qwen prompt and parses model output into separate
`function_call` output Items. Each output has a protocol Item `id` (`fc_...`) and a distinct
`call_id` (`call_...`). The client executes the function and sends a `function_call_output` Item in
a later request. NInfer does not execute functions or enforce JSON Schema through constrained
decoding, so `strict:true`, `tool_choice:required`, named tool choice, hosted tools, MCP tools, and
custom free-form tools are rejected.

### Response object and usage

A terminal wire response has `object: "response"`, one of `completed`, `incomplete`, or
`cancelled` in `status`, and a typed `output` array. NInfer may emit:

- a `reasoning` Item containing raw `reasoning_text` and an empty summary;
- an assistant `message` containing an `output_text` part;
- one or more `function_call` Items.

Ordinary model/string stops produce `completed`. Output-token or context-capacity exhaustion
produces `incomplete` with `incomplete_details.reason: "max_output_tokens"`. Errors accepted after
an SSE response has started produce `response.failed`; validation and preparation errors remain
normal HTTP error responses.

Usage is checkpoint-native:

```json
{
  "input_tokens": 42,
  "input_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 17},
  "output_tokens": 12,
  "output_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 5},
  "total_tokens": 54
}
```

`input_tokens` includes the chat template and expanded media tokens. `cached_tokens` is the exact
resident prompt prefix reused by Engine. `output_tokens` is the count of accepted generated token
IDs, including a withheld stop token when applicable. `reasoning_tokens` is counted in the Qwen
output decoder while accepted tokens are still in the reasoning channel; it is not estimated by
re-tokenizing decoded text.

### Responses streaming

Set `stream:true` for semantic Server-Sent Events. Every frame uses both the SSE event name and a
matching JSON `type`, and every JSON event has a monotonically increasing `sequence_number`:

```text
event: response.output_text.delta
data: {"type":"response.output_text.delta","sequence_number":7,...}

```

The normal lifecycle is:

1. `response.created`, then `response.in_progress`;
2. `response.output_item.added` and `response.content_part.added`;
3. zero or more `response.reasoning_text.delta` or `response.output_text.delta` events;
4. matching `*.done`, `response.content_part.done`, and `response.output_item.done` events;
5. exactly one `response.completed`, `response.incomplete`, or `response.failed` terminal event.

Function arguments use `response.function_call_arguments.delta` and `.done`. IDs, output indices,
and content indices remain stable, and concatenated deltas equal the terminal Item. Responses SSE
does not emit the Chat Completions `[DONE]` sentinel. With tools enabled, ordinary answer text still
streams immediately; only an ambiguous `<tool_call>` suffix or the structured tool region is held.
Malformed tool markup is flushed back as ordinary text without losing bytes.

### Local response state and resources

`store` defaults to `true`. Stored Responses live only in this server process and are bounded by an
LRU store. They are lost on restart and are not OpenAI's durable cloud retention service.

`previous_response_id` reconstructs the complete stored input/output Item history before the new
input. The current `instructions` value is placed first but is not saved into the continuation
context, matching the Responses rule that previous top-level instructions do not carry forward.
Function definitions are request configuration rather than conversation Items and must be sent
again on tool-result turns. The reconstructed prompt follows the ordinary Engine path, so resident
prefix reuse applies naturally.

A stored Response also retains its resolved `preserve_thinking` value. A child which omits the
field inherits the parent value. An explicit different value creates a new semantic branch; prompt
rendering and identity still determine reuse. Changing the boolean alone never invalidates an exact
current frontier or a complete matching rewrite checkpoint.

Resource behavior:

| Endpoint | Contract |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/responses/{id}` | returns the stored terminal object, or 404 `response_not_found` |
| `DELETE /v1/responses/{id}` | removes public retrieval and returns `response.deleted`; descendant contexts already retained by other Responses remain usable |
| `GET /v1/responses/{id}/input_items` | returns normalized Items supplied to that request; supports `after`, `limit` `1..100` (default `20`), and `order` `asc|desc` (default `desc`) |
| `POST /v1/responses/{id}/cancel` | explicitly fails because background execution is unsupported |
| `POST /v1/responses/compact` | explicitly fails with `compaction_not_supported` |

`store:false` Responses cannot be retrieved or used as `previous_response_id`. LRU eviction and
explicit deletion also make an ID unavailable. A single Response larger than the configured store
capacity fails with `response_store_capacity_exceeded` rather than silently pretending it was
stored.

### Responses input token count

`POST /v1/responses/input_tokens` accepts exactly `model` and `input`, performs the same typed Item,
template, and media expansion, and does not run generation:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/responses/input_tokens \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3.6-27b","input":"Count this prompt."}'
```

```json
{"object":"response.input_tokens","input_tokens":11}
```

Unsupported Create fields include Conversations, prompt templates, context management, hosted
moderation, prompt-cache controls, safety/user identifiers, Structured Outputs/JSON mode,
non-empty `include`, background execution, compaction, files/audio, and OpenAI-hosted/MCP/custom
tools. These are compatibility boundaries, not silently accepted placeholders.

## Anthropic Messages

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/messages \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.6-27b",
    "max_tokens": 128,
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain prefix reuse in one sentence."}
    ]
  }'
```

The endpoint supports top-level system text, ordered mid-conversation system messages,
user/assistant history, text and image blocks, thinking blocks, tool-use history, tool results,
client-defined tools, non-streaming responses, and Anthropic SSE events.
Mid-conversation system messages remain at their `messages` array position and are not merged into
the top-level system instruction. A system section must follow a user/tool-result message and be
final or immediately precede an assistant message; it cannot interrupt a tool-use/tool-result pair.
Consecutive system messages remain separate ordered turns.

`thinking.type: "disabled"` disables thinking; other supported values enable it.
The independent top-level `preserve_thinking` boolean controls closed-turn history and otherwise
uses the server default.

Anthropic `output_config.effort` accepts the protocol values `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and
`max`. The value is then checked against the loaded chat template in the same way as the OpenAI
endpoints; the registered effort-capable template exposes `low`, `medium`, and `xhigh`. Combining
an effort with `thinking.type: "disabled"` is rejected as contradictory.

Anthropic's `model` field is treated as a response label and does not select the loaded artifact.

`POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` uses the artifact's tokenizer, chat template, and media expansion
without running GPU generation:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/messages/count_tokens \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.6-27b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Count this prompt."}]
  }'
```

## Authentication and CORS

Pass `--api-key VALUE` to require the same value as an OpenAI bearer token or Anthropic
`x-api-key` header. `GET /health` and CORS preflight requests remain unauthenticated.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/models \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer local-secret'
```

`--cors` adds permissive browser CORS headers. It is disabled by default.

Engine selects sampling defaults from the loaded model and the request's resolved thinking mode.
Qwen3.6-27B and Qwen3.8-27B use `1.0/0.95/20/0/0` for
temperature/top-p/top-k/min-p/presence penalty in thinking mode and `0.7/0.80/20/0/1.5` in
non-thinking mode. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B differs only in its thinking presence penalty, which is `1.5`.
Frequency penalty is `0` for all registered presets. Process flags override registered values,
request fields override process flags, and `--greedy` finally forces temperature `0`.

## Structured request log

`--request-log-jsonl FILE` enables the machine-readable measurement log. The server opens `FILE`
in append mode and flushes every event, so successive model or MTP blocks may share one campaign
file. The parent directory must already exist. Failure to open the file aborts startup; the log path
is also rejected if it resolves to the model artifact.

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --request-log-jsonl profiles/bench/run/server.requests.jsonl
```

Every line is one `ninfer_serve_request_log` schema-v10 JSON object. All events carry
`timestamp_unix_ms` and a process-unique `server_instance_id`; request IDs are monotonic only within
that server instance. Successful request-start records include request-scoped acquisition,
media-preprocessing wall/work, tokenizer, cache hit/miss/single-flight, and payload-size fields;
they do not infer request behavior from process-global counter deltas.

| Event | Contents |
|---|---|
| `server_start` | target/weights identity and artifact, resolved Engine including tensor-parallel width `tp` and the resolved per-rank `devices` list, registered thinking/non-thinking sampler defaults plus process overrides, thinking-history defaults, weights/sequence/workspace/request-transient arenas, KV sizing ledger, CUDA Graph observed/allowance bytes, CUDA/GPU environment, and redacted argv |
| `request_start` | protocol, resolved sampler and seed, thinking modes, Responses semantic-change flag, output budget, stream/message/tool shape |
| `request_rejected` | parsed request shape, media-item count, `phase: "prepare"`, and the exact HTTP status/type/code/parameter/message for a synchronous preparation rejection |
| `request_done` | finish reason, prompt/completion/cache/computed-prefill tokens, prefix reuse path, unrounded phase seconds, and complete speculative-decoding counters |
| `request_error` | the resolved request configuration and generation error message |
| `throughput` | interval token deltas and rates, scheduler occupancy, and decode-round batch statistics |

At `--tp 2` every other `engine` and `memory` field in `server_start` is the primary rank's; `tp`
and `devices` are what identify the record as a dual-device run and name the second GPU. Per-device
memory rows remain a console load-summary table rather than structured-log fields.

`request_done.timings_seconds` contains `prepare`, `ttft`, `vision`, `prefill`, `decode`, and `total`
as full-precision JSON numbers. Its `speculative` object contains `backend`, `draft_window`, `rounds`,
`drafted_tokens`, `accepted_tokens`, `fallback_steps`, and `accepted_per_position`. Rates can be
derived downstream from raw token counts and seconds instead of rounded stderr strings.

The JSONL file contains no generated response text and never records an API-key value; `argv`
replaces that value with `<redacted>`. The existing stderr summaries remain available for operators
but are rounded and are not the aggregation source. Console lines use local
`[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm] [level]` timestamps. OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat, and Anthropic
generation requests receive a request ID when they enter synchronous preparation. Successful
preparation produces `request_start`; a preparation failure produces `request_rejected` without a
matching start. Later generation failures produce `request_error`. Schema/model validation
rejections before preparation and token-count-only calls are not measurement requests and do not
receive request IDs.

By default the server also reports aggregate activity every five seconds. `prefill` counts prompt
suffix tokens actually computed during the interval, excluding prefix-cache hits; `decode` counts
tokens finally committed by decode rounds, excluding the first token produced by prefill. For MTP
and DFlash this is the accepted committed output, not draft or rejected tokens.
`avg_decode_batch` is decode row-rounds divided by decode rounds during the same interval. The
`running`, `prefilling`, `decode_ready`, and `waiting` fields are the Engine scheduler snapshot at
the end of the interval. Fully idle zero intervals are omitted. The JSONL `throughput` event keeps
the raw token and round deltas as well as derived rates; downstream measurement should prefer those
raw values.

## Execution behavior

The server owns one resident Engine with a startup-fixed capacity of `1..8` active generation
requests. At each decode boundary, every decode-ready request is compacted into one batch and
processed by one model traversal and, when graphs are enabled, one exact-batch CUDA Graph replay. A
request joins that batch only after its single-request prefill finishes; when it completes or is
cancelled, the next boundary rebuilds the batch without an empty row.

`--max-pending-requests` bounds the requests waiting behind the active set. The total generation
request lifetime capacity is `max_concurrency + max_pending_requests`, including requests still in
CPU/media preparation and completed model results whose response has not yet been released. A full
capacity returns HTTP 429 with code `server_overloaded`. The absolute
`--pending-timeout-ms` deadline starts before preparation, covers media acquisition and Engine FIFO
waiting, and returns HTTP 503 with code `request_queue_timeout` if admission does not occur in time.
There is no admission ETA or unbounded overflow queue.

Input memory is bounded by the outstanding-request count and the per-request
`--max-request-mib` limit. Media requests additionally share one preparation permit, so a waiting
media request retains the same cancellation and timeout deadline. Model output is bounded by the
same finite request count and each request's effective output-token limit; output callbacks and
network serialization run outside the GPU executor and do not delay formation of the next batch.

`--max-context` and the resolved `--kv-capacity` are independent limits. The former is each
sequence's logical ceiling; the latter sizes the shared Main Text KV pool used by all active
requests and retained prefixes. Both are represented with 64-token pages internally, while a
sequence can never cross the exact `--max-context` frontier. `--kv-capacity N` requests an explicit
capacity; `--kv-capacity auto` chooses the largest legal capacity that fits the memory remaining
after weights are loaded while keeping 1 GiB of sizing headroom. When omitted it follows
`--max-context`, preserving one full-length request's capacity. The shared pool is fixed at startup
and is not divided evenly among request lanes.

Automatic sizing evaluates the complete target runtime layout for the chosen concurrency, KV
dtype, speculative backend, draft window, Vision setting, workspace, and CUDA Graph allowance. It
uses a direct page-capacity calculation rather than allocation probing. Startup reports the policy,
resolved capacity, runtime reservation, free memory after weights, automatic headroom, planned
slack, actual free memory after complete startup, and observed Graph memory. An explicit capacity
is never silently reduced, and neither policy permits request-time pool growth.

Admission reserves the full prompt-plus-effective-output page entitlement, so an admitted request
can finish within its declared bound. A later request waits in FIFO order when the remaining shared
pages cannot satisfy its complete entitlement; the Engine never admits it and later truncates an
older request to recover capacity. Startup rejects a KV pool smaller than one sequence, too small to
provide one page per configured lane, or larger than all configured lanes could use.

Compatible resident prefixes are reused for both text and multimodal histories unless the server is
started with `--no-prefix-reuse`. A multimodal hit requires matching token types, three-axis MRoPE
positions, encoded-media digest, grid, and consumer spans; changing an earlier image or video
therefore resets the prefix instead of reusing placeholder-token KV. Media wholly inside a matched
prefix skips Vision execution, while new suffix media is encoded normally. The completion log
reports the reused token count as `cache=`.

The shared family runtime distinguishes `full_reset`, `append_frontier`,
`restore_turn_checkpoint`, and `restore_response_checkpoint`. Both checkpoint kinds include the
recurrent, hidden, and selected speculative-backend continuation state required to recompute a
rewritten suffix; matching KV tokens alone never authorize a partial hit. With stable
`preserve_thinking=true`, the auxiliary checkpoint rolls to the prompt frontier after the current
response's complete deterministic generation prologue. For thinking generation this includes
`<think>\n`; for non-thinking generation it includes the complete empty thinking block. Capturing
that frontier does not split a tiny trailing prologue into a separate prefill unit, and a normalized
response which no longer matches the raw generated tokens replays only that response and its
suffix. Stable `false` keeps the first assistant opener in the open turn so a newly closed turn can
be recomputed without its reasoning.

`preserve_thinking` selects where the next checkpoint should live; it is not a cache-compatibility
bit. An exact current frontier or matching complete checkpoint remains reusable across a mode
change. If the newly desired boundary is already behind the selected reuse frontier and no snapshot
exists there, the Engine keeps the valid hit and defers installing that new checkpoint rather than
forcing an eager full reset. A later request that diverges before every retained checkpoint then
resets normally. The JSONL completion record exposes the checkpoint actually restored as
`prefix_reuse_path`. Changing reasoning effort changes rendered tokens and therefore does not reuse
a prefix whose effort instruction differs.

An appended mid-conversation system message is an ordinary prompt suffix, so an unchanged prior
history remains eligible for `append_frontier`. If the client modifies, removes, or moves a
historical system message, the token prefix genuinely differs and a miss/reset is correct.

Speculative decoding is an engine option and does not change protocol output shapes, stop behavior,
or usage accounting. If a stop truncates a multi-token MTP or DFlash round, the Engine commits the
exact accepted target prefix so a following compatible turn can still reuse it. Output-limit and
context-capacity finishes map to `length`/ `max_tokens`; ordinary model or string stops map to
`stop`/ `end_turn`.

Function tools are rendered into the model prompt and generated calls are parsed into protocol
responses. NInfer does not execute tools and does not enforce client JSON Schema through constrained
decoding.

Prompt-token usage includes chat-template and expanded media tokens. Generated-token usage comes
from accepted output token IDs, including a stop token whose decoded text may be withheld.

Generated text is always valid UTF-8. The checkpoint vocabulary is byte-level, so a single code
point can span several generated tokens: the Engine holds an incomplete trailing sequence and
publishes it in the delta that completes it, and no streamed chunk ever ends part-way through a
code point. A generated byte sequence that no continuation can complete -- a byte-level token that
can neither begin nor continue a code point, or a code point cut short by the output-token limit --
is published as one U+FFFD replacement character per ill-formed sequence. This is a per-request
text outcome: it never fails the request and never takes the server out of service. Token
accounting is unaffected, since the generated token IDs remain exactly what the model produced.
