 *   gate_up = Linear(x, gate_up_weight); M=gate_up_rows/2;
 *   ideal[i,t] = SiLU(gate_up[i,t]) * gate_up[M+i,t].
 *
 * Logical shapes / supported domain:
 *   T may be any positive value. The registered profiles are:
 *   - Q4G64_F16S weight [34816,5120], x [5120,T], out [17408,T];
 *   - W8G32_F16S weight [12288,2048], x [2048,T], out [6144,T];
 *   - NVFP4 BlockScaleK16M128x4 weight [34816,5120], x [5120,T], out [17408,T];
 *   - FP8_E4M3FN_ROW_BF16S RowScale weight [34816,5120], x [5120,T], out [17408,T].
 *   Inputs and output are contiguous BF16. Q4/W8 scales are FP16, NVFP4 scales are E4M3FN, and
 *   row-scaled FP8 has one BF16 multiplier per gate/up parent row. Gate rows `[0,17408)` precede
 *   their matching up rows `[17408,34816)`.
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   The oracle exact-decodes the registered weight and evaluates `ideal` naively in FP64 from the
 *   represented inputs. The BF16 output is promoted and compared directly with that result; output
 *   storage rounding belongs to LinearSwiGLU's named activation-compute criterion, not the oracle.
 *   Production routes may fuse or materialize gate/up and may choose their natural accumulator,
 *   staging, and workspace precision; those private choices are not semantic rounding boundaries.
 *   Under AllowA8, row-scaled FP8 resolves T=1 and every T>=3 to A8 and T=2 to fused A16 SIMT;
 *   A16Only uses fused A16 kernels for every positive T.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Writes the full output; x/weight and output must not alias.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   Caller-owned transient storage reported by linear_swiglu_workspace_capacity_bytes(),
 *   scoped to the call. W8, NVFP4 A16, and row-scaled FP8 A16 require zero bytes; A4/A8 routes use
 *   caller-owned activation storage and may use private projection storage. There is no persistent
 *   state side effect.

// --- Tensor-parallel split form (tp == 2) -------------------------------------------------------
//
// linear_swiglu is a COLUMN-parallel (output-split) op only: variant.cpp's real MLP call graph
// (Variant::post_mixer, src/targets/qwen3_6_27b/impl/variant.cpp) is
//
//   ops::linear_swiglu(hidden, weights.gate_up, activation, ...);   // THIS op -- gate_up + SiLU
//   ops::linear_add(activation, weights.down, residual, ...);       // a SEPARATE op
//
// so linear_swiglu's own semantic contract stops at `activation`; the down projection, its
// residual, and its all-reduce belong to linear_add_row_parallel() (include/ninfer/ops/
// linear_add.h), which already registers the mlp/down [5120,17408] row-shard problems. This
// split form does not touch down/residual at all -- do not re-implement what a sibling enabled.
//
// The ShardPlan (src/targets/qwen3_6_27b/impl/load/bindings.cpp, `ends("mlp/gate_up")`) splits
// gate_up [34816,5120] as TWO column blocks -- gate [0,17408) and up [17408,34816) -- each split
// independently by tp, so rank r's shard weight is the CONCATENATION of gate rows
// [r*8704,(r+1)*8704) and up rows [17408+r*8704,17408+(r+1)*8704): a standalone [17408,5120]
// tensor in the SAME "gate rows [0,M) then up rows [M,2M)" layout linear_swiglu() itself already
// assumes, at M=8704 instead of M=17408. Rank r therefore computes
//
//   activation[r][i,t] = SiLU(gate_up[r][i,t]) * gate_up[r][M+i,t],   i in [0,8704), M=8704,
//
// entirely from its own shard and its own (replicated) activation block -- no cross-device
// traffic, matching linear_column_parallel()'s own column-parallel contract. Rank r's output IS
// directly the down-projection's rank r input block (linear_add_row_parallel()'s `x[r]`); the two
// Ops compose end to end without any reshaping between them.
//
// Three formats are registered, per the real ShardPlan/binding profiles (bindings.cpp
// `bind_nvfp4_text_layers`/`bind_groupwise_text_layers`/`bind_qwen38_nvfp4_text_layers`):
//   - NVFP4: a TRUE split. The fused decode/small-T/W4A4/TMA kernels are templated on Geometry
//     (src/ops/linear_swiglu/nvfp4/*.cu) and instantiated at BOTH Nvfp4MlpGateUpGeometry (tp1) and
//     Nvfp4MlpGateUpTp2ColumnGeometry (the shard, src/ops/linear/nvfp4/nvfp4_config.h) -- the same
//     kernel template halves its own indexing at the shard's M, the same way every other split
//     family here works: a shard is a standalone tensor of the same layout with one axis narrowed,
//     so the existing kernel instantiated at that shape IS the split kernel. Route selection
//     (resolve_route) is a pure function of (policy, token count), inherited unchanged from the
//     parent.
//   - FP8_E4M3FN_ROW_BF16S (the flagship's own MLP-tail format, Text layers 56-63): a
//     TRUE split, exactly the same shape of change as NVFP4's above. The fused decode/small-T/A8
//     kernels are templated on Geometry (src/ops/linear_swiglu/fp8/*.cu) and instantiated at both
//     Fp8MlpGateUpGeometry (tp1) and Fp8MlpGateUpTp2ColumnGeometry (the shard,
//     src/ops/linear/fp8/fp8_config.h). Route selection is inherited unchanged from the tp1
//     resolve_route (a pure function of (policy, token count)).
//   - Q4G64_F16S (groupwise profile): COMPOSED, not extended. Every one of Q4's own linear_swiglu
//     kernels (src/ops/linear_swiglu/q4/*.cu) is a compile-time-exact template hardcoded to
//     [34816,17408,5120] with no runtime-N/K escape hatch, the same shape of limitation BF16's
//     linear_add family has. Rather than instantiate a whole new exact kernel set for one shard
//     shape, the shard composes the ALREADY tp2-shard-capable ops::linear() (whose Q4 registry
//     admits [17408,5120] as a column geometry) with the standalone silu_mul() Op -- the exact
//     fallback Q4's OWN tp1 "Materialized" route (src/ops/linear_swiglu/q4/q4_linear_swiglu_plan.
//     cpp) already takes above T=48, just requiring a workspace at every token count here (the
//     tp1 Materialized route needs none only because ops::linear()'s A16-only Q4 launchers happen
//     to need none at ANY registered N/K, per ops::linear's own Q4 dispatch; Q4's A16-only
//     convenience overload of THIS Op therefore still requires a non-null workspace, unlike
//     NVFP4's).
//
// W8G32_F16S is NOT registered here: its linear_swiglu profile ([12288,2048]) belongs only to the
// MTP head, which stays single-device (never sharded by the qwen3_6_27b ShardPlan).
//
// Every requirement of linear_swiglu() applies per rank (BF16 dtype, contiguity, 16-byte
// alignment, x/out non-aliasing). The caller obligations of src/ops/common/split_launch.h apply
// unchanged: rank r's work is issued on ec.dev[r]->stream with that rank's device current, and
// activations staged with the plain cudaMemcpy/cudaMemset/<<<...>>> forms must be retired (they
// land on the LEGACY DEFAULT stream, which does not implicitly synchronize with
// DeviceContext::stream) before this call reads them.
