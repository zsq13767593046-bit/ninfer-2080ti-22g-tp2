 * @brief Applies a bias-free matrix projection independently to every input column.
 *
 * @details The ideal mathematical result is
 *
 * @f[
 *   \mathrm{ideal}_{n,t} =
 *   \sum_{k=0}^{K-1}
 *     \mathrm{FP32Dequant}(w)_{n,k}\,\mathrm{FP32}(x_{k,t}).
 * @f]
 *
 * `out` stores a BF16 approximation of this ideal result under the named numerical criterion for
 * the selected private activation-compute path.
 *
 * @par Logical tensors and layout
 * `x` is contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 `[K,T]`, `w` has logical shape `[N,K]`, and
 * `out` is contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 `[N,T]`. Every logical extent is positive;
 * in particular, `T=0` is invalid rather than a no-op. Dimension zero is stored fastest. The Op has
 * no bias, activation, residual addition, or transpose mode.
 *
 * @par Supported execution domain
 * Registered execution uses RowSplit Q4G64_F16S, Q5G64_F16S, Q6G64_F16S, or W8G32_F16S weights
 * with FP16 scales, block-scaled NVFP4 weights, row-scaled FP8_E4M3FN_ROW_BF16S weights, plus
 * registered contiguous BF16_CTRL problems. Each format owns a finite registry of exact physical
 * weight problems and selects its kernel internally; a valid encoding and alignment do not imply
 * arbitrary N/K support. FP8 currently registers `[N,K]` in `{[14336,5120], [16384,5120],
 * [34816,5120], [248320,5120], [5120,6144], [5120,17408]}` at every positive T. The current NVFP4
 * problems register the five non-vocabulary FP8 geometries and accept every positive T. Text and
 * MTP packed-weight problems accept every positive column extent T. Registered Vision problems
 * accept raw-patch P in `{4,8,...,131072}` or merged-token V in `[1,32768]`; a matrix column does
 * not inherently represent a text token. FP32_CTRL is unsupported.
 *
 * @par Numerical contract
 * Test fixture code materializes the persistent weight as its logical FP32 dequantized matrix.
 * The one Linear oracle accepts that matrix and the FP32 values represented by the BF16 activation,
 * evaluates every complete dot product with naive FP64 accumulation, and retains the FP64 result.
 * The BF16 output is promoted and compared against that result. Output representation,
 * accumulator precision, activation quantization, staging, reduction order, and kernel schedule
 * are private implementation effects covered by the named tolerance for the selected
 * activation-compute path; none is copied into the oracle. Kernel, schedule, template instance,
 * host launcher, and T region do not create separate criteria inside one path.
 *
 * @par Compute policy
 * `policy` specifies the permitted private activation-compute set. A permission does not require a
 * corresponding low-precision route: the resolved plan may remain A16 when that is the qualified
 * choice. BF16_CTRL admits only LinearPolicy::A16Only. Registered Q4/Q5/Q6/W8 formats admit
 * LinearPolicy::A16Only and LinearPolicy::AllowA8. The five non-vocabulary FP8 problems admit the
 * same two policies at every positive T. AllowA8 resolves `[14336,5120]` to A16 through T=11 and
 * A8 from T=12; `[16384,5120]` to A16 through T=10 and A8 from T=11; `[34816,5120]` to A8 at T=1,
 * A16 at T=2..4, and A8 from T=5; both `[5120,6144]` and `[5120,17408]` resolve T<25 to A16 and
 * T>=25 to A8. FP8 `[248320,5120]` admits A16Only, AllowA8, and AllowA4; every policy retains A16
 * compute at every positive T. NVFP4 admits A16Only and AllowA4; AllowA4 permits the private
 * resolver to select either a qualified A16 route or activation quantization to NVFP4 at every
 * positive T. The selected route depends only on the registered problem and T.
 *
 * @par Workspace
 * `workspace` is caller-owned call-scoped transient storage sized by
 * linear_workspace_capacity_bytes(). It must not overlap x, any weight plane, or out. Linear does
 * not allocate device memory internally.
 *
 * @param[in] x Contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 input matrix `[K,T]`.
 * @param[in] w Logical weight matrix `[N,K]` in a registered persistent format and layout.
 * @param[out] out Contiguous, non-null, 16-byte-aligned BF16 output matrix `[N,T]`. It must not

// --- Tensor-parallel split forms (tp == 2) ----------------------------------------------------
//
// Both forms are compositions of the single-device linear() above, not separate kernels: a shard
// is a standalone `[N,K]` tensor of the same registered format with one axis narrowed -- exactly
// what the tp2 loader materializes into each device's arena -- so the existing kernel run against
// a shard weight already halves its grid along the split axis and already reads only that device's
// bytes. The split forms add the per-rank device/stream discipline, the cross-rank shape
// agreement a single device cannot check, and (row-parallel only) the summing collective.
//
// Every requirement of linear() applies per rank. `x[r]`, `w[r]`, `out[r]`, and `workspace[r]`
// must be resident on `ec.dev[r]`, and rank r's work is enqueued on `ec.dev[r]->stream`. The
// CALLER OBLIGATION of include/ninfer/ops/allreduce.h therefore applies here too: inputs staged
// with the plain cudaMemcpy/cudaMemset/`<<<...>>>` forms land on a device's LEGACY DEFAULT stream,
// which does not implicitly synchronize with `DeviceContext::stream`, and must be retired before
// the call. Neither form synchronizes; on return the work is enqueued on both streams. The
// caller's current CUDA device is preserved.
//
// The shard shapes must themselves be registered problems of the weight's format. The tp2 halves
// of every registered non-vocabulary geometry are registered; an unregistered shard shape is
// rejected exactly as an unregistered whole shape is.
