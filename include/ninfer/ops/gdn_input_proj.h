 * selects A16 through T=7 and private activation quantization followed by A8 Tensor Core
 * contraction at every T>=8. Every route writes the two independent final allocations directly.
 * The complete projection is evaluated against the same exact-decode/naive-FP64 oracle;
 * activation quantization and the production reduction profile are private effects covered by the
 * selected criterion. x, both persistent weight planes, qkv, z, and the live workspace must be

 *
 * Effects:
 *   Each row writes query/key/value through its valid prefix and exact zero to its invalid tail;

// DESIGN NOTE. These two Ops are reached only from Phase::Verify (the MTP / speculative-verify
// path), so their split is the composition of the bare projection's column shard (above) with the
// GDN convolution's channel shard, rather than anything either of those owns on its own.
//
// GEOMETRY. Device r owns 8 of the 16 GDN key heads and 24 of the 48 GDN value heads, so its
// projection shard is [8192,5120] (Nvfp4/Fp8GdnInputTp2ColumnGeometry, above) and its
// convolution owns 5120 of the 10240 depthwise channels:
//
//   shard-local Q [0,1024) | K [1024,2048) | V [2048,5120)     (conv channels; 5120 total)
//   shard-local Z [0,3072)                                     (bypasses the convolution)
//
// This is byte-for-byte the channel set `gdn/convolution`'s three-block ShardPlan gives device r
// (bindings.cpp's `gdn/convolution` branch: channels [1024r,+1024) u [2048+1024r,+1024) u
// [4096+3072r,+3072)) and the packing `gdn_input_proj_column_parallel` already writes, so nothing
// repacks between the projection and the convolution.
// Per-device operand shapes: x [5120,W,B], conv_weight [5120,4], conv_states [5120,3,Slots],
// query/key [1024,W,B], value [3072,W,B], z [3072,W,B], conv_record [5120,T,B].
//
// NO COLLECTIVE. The convolution is depthwise and the projection is column-parallel, so a device's
// 5120 channels never mix with the peer's. Both Ops are entirely local; the GDN block's one and
// only all-reduce is the row-parallel `gdn/output` projection at the very end.
//
// ROUTE. The shard always takes the COMPOSED route (projection shard -> BF16 projected plane ->
// the channel-generic projected-conv kernel), never a fused per-format snapshot kernel. The fused
// NVFP4/FP8/W8 snapshot kernels bake the tp1 row profile into compile-time constants, and
// instantiating a parallel exact set at the shard profile is kernel work, not the registry work
// a shard geometry otherwise needs; the composed route is the same arithmetic in the same order at
// one extra kernel launch and one BF16 staging round for query/key/value. This is the one route
// fall-off the conv snapshot/record shards carry, and it is a performance item only: FP8 is
// bit-exact against the tp1 reference at every case covered by ninfer_mtp_split_test, and NVFP4
// is bit-exact wherever the tp1 path is also composed.
