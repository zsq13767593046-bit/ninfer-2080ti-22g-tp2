# Qwen3.8-27B for NInfer

This model card is the version-controlled source for
[neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer).

The repository contains
[Qwen3.8-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B) converted to the native
[NInfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) `.ninfer` artifact format. The artifact is intended
only for NInfer; it is not a Transformers checkpoint, Safetensors distribution, or GGUF file.

## Artifact

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Filename | `qwen3_8_27b.ninfer` |
| Size | 18,210,531,328 bytes (16.96 GiB) |
| SHA-256 | `eec39564993d6e9c7d5e383382a760f093465c9d163ec9a1bd6b80199514bf3e` |
| Container version | 2 |
| NInfer model ID | `qwen3.8-27b` |
| NInfer weights ID | `groupwise-int` |
| NInfer target key | `qwen3_8_27b` |
| Stored objects | 1,124 (1,118 tensors and 6 resources) |

The Text body uses the registered Q4/Q5/Q6 groupwise allocation, while the token embedding and
full output head use `W8G32_F16S`. The file also contains the registered Vision, MTP,
proposal-head, tokenizer, chat-template, generation, and media-processor objects required by
NInfer.

Verify a downloaded file with:

```bash
printf '%s  %s\n' \
  'eec39564993d6e9c7d5e383382a760f093465c9d163ec9a1bd6b80199514bf3e' \
  'qwen3_8_27b.ninfer' | sha256sum --check
```

## Requirements

- [NInfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) revision
  [`5232055`](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/commit/52320554b5e71a9da96bff809ddf67ac5773ed63)
  or later, built from source;
- 64-bit Linux;
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (`sm_120a`);
- CUDA Toolkit 13.1 or newer.

NInfer does not provide an install target or packaged binary. See the
[repository README](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer#build) for source-build dependencies.

## Download and run

```bash
hf download neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer \
  qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --local-dir models

./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --prompt "Explain prefill and decode in three sentences." \
  --max-context 16384 \
  --max-new 256 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

For images, videos, structured chat history, and HTTP serving, see the
[NInfer documentation](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/tree/master/docs).

## Supported use

The artifact supports:

- text generation in thinking and non-thinking modes;
- image, multi-image, video, and mixed multimodal messages;
- MTP speculative decoding with draft windows from one to five;
- BF16 and INT8 group-64 KV cache;
- CUDA Graph decode and compatible-prefix reuse;
- startup-bounded small-scale concurrent serving with true batched decode;
- the NInfer CLI;
- OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible serving.

## Evaluation

The artifact was evaluated through NInfer's OpenAI-compatible serving route with thinking enabled,
MTP=3, and INT8 group-64 KV. EvalScope 1.9.0 used 0-shot prompts, rule-based scoring, and one sample
per problem with temperature 1.0, top-p 0.95, top-k 20, presence penalty 0.0, and seed 42. The text
suite ran at a 262,144-token context limit; the multimodal suite ran with `--vision` at a
81,920-token limit.

| Benchmark | NInfer groupwise-int | Correct / total | Official Qwen3.8-27B BF16 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| IFBench (prompt-level strict) | 77.67% | 233 / 300 | 79.5 |
| AIME 2025 | 96.67% | 29 / 30 | — |
| AIME 2026 | 96.67% | 29 / 30 | — |
| GPQA-Diamond | 87.37% | 173 / 198 | 89.2 |
| ERQA | 66.25% | 265 / 400 | 65.5 |
| RealWorldQA | 82.22% | 629 / 765 | 85.9 |

All 1,723 configured samples completed and were scored. IFBench additionally reports 81.00%
instruction-level strict, 80.67% prompt-level loose, and 83.67% instruction-level loose. These are
single-sample results, not pass@k.

The official Qwen3.8-27B BF16 figures come from the
[upstream model card](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B); its sampling settings and IFBench
metric level are not stated there, so the last column is not a same-protocol comparison. The
groupwise-int deltas stay within ±3.1 points on the four overlapping benchmarks, and the upstream
card reports no AIME results.

## Limits

- The artifact is accepted only by NInfer revision `5232055` or later and the matching registered
  target.
- NInfer executes on one RTX 5090 and one CUDA device, with a startup-fixed capacity of 1–8 active
  requests per Engine.
- It does not provide large-scale or preemptive continuous batching, priority/QoS scheduling,
  multi-GPU execution, CPU/GPU offload, or distributed serving.
- Context allocation is subject to GPU memory and the selected KV-cache type.
- NInfer does not execute generated tool calls.
